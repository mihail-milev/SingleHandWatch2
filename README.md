# SingleHandWatch2
Continuation of SingleHandWatch - a single-hand 24-hour watch face app for Apple Watch

# About
This is the continuation of the previous project - SingleHandWatch. It is again a single hand watch with a 24-hour scala, but this time, only a part of the scala is displayed. This part is also zoomed.

# Why a second app?
Because, living with the first version for two weeks, I saw, that is very hard to recognise time at first glance. I always had to look longer at the watch to recognise the time. That's why I decided to "zoom-in". But I also wanted to show only as much as needed and "hide" the rest.

# How does it work
While the hand is moving, the scala also updates automatically, so you can always recognise the right time fast.

# About the watches
I've always loved single-hand watches. These are watches, where you have a 24-hour scala and a single hand. One can never say the exact time, but works in either 10- or 15-minutes intervals. Some people even say, that they are better able to plan their time this way.
I was quite disappointed, that Apple does not allow us to create custom watch faces. So this is my custom solution.

# Disclaimer
This is an app, that cannot be distributed on the App Store. Apple does not allow us to distribute apps, which sole purpose is to show the time. The only way to use this app is to have a developer account, download the sources, compile them yourself and install them on your device.

# How to read the watch
Big orange lines show you 12 a.m., 6 a.m., 12 a.m. and 18 a.m. When the hand is down - it is midnight, to the left - it is morning, up - it is noon, to the right - it is evening.
Small lines are always the half of an hour.
The dots show you every 15 minutes.

# Why?
I've decided to upload this code, because of two reasons:
1. I would like to show, that there are (although very limited) possibilities to have some custom "watch faces". I hope that Apple would allow us at some point to develop our own watch faces. There are a lot of cool ideas out there, which are just missing and not possible to develop using "allowed" techniques.
2. I wanted to learn Swift. This was my first app. Coming from an Objective-C and learning Elixir for several months, I wanted to see how good Swift mixes both worlds. I find it fascinating, how intelligent and clean code can be, when using all these techniques.
